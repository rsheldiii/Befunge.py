BEFUNGE.py

a befunge interpreter, written in python. just because.


I've currently passed the befunge-93 specification, and I'm working towards getting the interpreter funge-98 compliant, while adding the ability to parse CSV files (which make it a million times easier to edit). it should still work though!
